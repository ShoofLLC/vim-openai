# vim-openai

## Description
A neovim plugin for openai codex. 

This plugin was also written with the help of codex.

## Installation

In order for the plugin to work, you need to set the "OPENAI_API_KEY" environment variable to your api key (see [openai developer quickstart](https://beta.openai.com/docs/developer-quickstart))

You also need (currently) to add a few packages to your nvim-python3 environment:
- openai package
- click

both can be installed with pip:
```bash
pip install click openai
```

For more information on python in nvim read the provider help
```vim
:help provider-python
```


### install using dein:
```
call dein#add('ShoofLLC/vim-openai', {'merged': 0})
```
### install using VimPlug:
```
Plug 'ShoofLLC/vim-openai'
```

### install using Vundle:
```
Plugin 'ShoofLLC/vim-openai'
```

### install using NeoBundle:
```
NeoBundle 'ShoofLLC/vim-openai'
```

## Usage
The plugin provides one command "CodexHelp".
An example of how to map this command is found in [vim_openai.vim](https://github.com/ShoofLLC/vim-openai/blob/main/plugin/vim_openai.vim)

Visually select some text then press F7 to use the selected text as prompt to open ai codex.

You can also combine the text selection and the command in one go
```
" This command will select the entire file and send it to openai-codex
" Be careful not to use it on files containing sensitive information
nnoremap <c-n> gg0vG$h:<c-u>call CodexHelp(visualmode())<CR> " Map Ctrl-n
```

## Known Issues
The python dependencies have to be installed manually.

This plugin has only been tested with nvim 0.5+, this is a very early version of the plugin so everything can go wrong.
